        <p>PROSPECT HEIGHTS  – It took Antonio Vilchis ten years of running Mexicocina in the Bronx (eleven this November) to consider venturing into Brooklyn, and he does not regret it.  Mexicocina Agaveria, a tidy, small space on Washington Avenue on the edge of Prospect Heights and Crown Heights, opened on March 11.</p>

        <p>PARK SLOPE – Contestants at Artichoke Basille’s Pizza eating contest dripped with sweat as they shoved yet another slice into their mouths. And then, another. When you thought they were going to burst, they ate another.</p>

        <p>The fourth annual contest took place last Saturday, the 17th, on Park Slope’s 5th Avenue during the Summer Stroll series, organized by the 5th Avenue Business Improvement District (BID).  There was also salsa dancing, a bouncy castle, and live music.</p>

        <p>PLG -  The new space at Amy Thai Bistro, one of the only Thai restaurants on Flatbush Avenue, has a minimal design. The walls are a crisp white, and the dishware come in mismatched, rich colors. It feels chic, but warm and inviting.</p>

        <p>This all makes perfect sense once you meet the woman who designed it. Karnchana Vongsawat, known to many as Amy, has worked in the business for years. You might have seen her at Am Thai Bistro, the neighborhood favorite on Church Avenue, which she runs with her business partner, Boonnum Tongngeon. In the last year, both partners, while still working at and operating Am Thai, opened places of their own. Tongngeon’s new place, Thai Cook, opened in Queens about two months after Amy’s. These new restaurants are not sisters to Am Thai, but instead, represent the women as individuals.</p>

        <p>WILLIAMSBURG – Bryan Chunton has kept almost the entirety of his old staff, over ten people, since the original location of his restaurant Zen Yai Noodle & Coffee – a Vietnamese Cafe – burned down last year in Sunnyside, Queens. He jokes that maybe it’s his good looks that keep them around.</p>

        <p>BAY RIDGE – Just off of the Bay Ridge Avenue R stop, you will find Blend Coffee + CoWork. Right now, at least from the outside, it is a little unassuming—signs and lights are still being installed, but the story behind its origin is anything but. </p>

        <p>Justin Mattera is a pastor, as well as the owner of marketing business. Born and raised in the area where his family has lived for four generations, he never seriously thought that he would own a coffee shop.</p>

        <p>BENSONHURST – 18th Avenue in Bensonhurst is home to a uniquely wonderful pairing of cultures. These cultures, Chinese and Italian primarily, manifest themselves in a sweet, flaky, and delicious way at the bakeries that line the avenue. In honor of the Santa Rosalia festival, which is on until the first of September, we walked the length of 18th Avenue and tried every bakery we could find.</p>
           
        <p>There was something to like at every single one, whether it was the espresso-drinking men chatting by the picturesque marzipan creations at Villabate, or kids playing video games at Best Bakery. Each had a distinct and friendly community hanging about inside, each was full of those who knew each other, and each is worth its own trip.</p>

        <p>EAST NEW YORK/LINDEN MALL – The best lunch around Linden Mall is at Policano’s Italian Sausage truck.</p>

        <p>Doug Policano has been parking his truck on the north side of Linden Boulevard at 79th Street since 1978, right on the border of Brooklyn and Queens, and locals claim you won’t find a better sausage in either borough. Policiano’s Italian Sausage is about one thing, and one thing only – and it’s right there in the name, and also on the license plate. Sausage. </p>

        <p>CARROLL GARDENS – Milan Schwartz grew up working in the bakery owned by his grandparents, the much-loved Shlukers in Brooklyn, and has now gone on to open an ice cream shop with his wife, Samantha, called Sweet Intentions. The shop is small, pleasantly decorated with a big pink neon sign proclaiming “I licked it, so it’s mine”.</p>

        <p>Sweet Intentions, located at 306 Court Street between Degraw and Sackett, the first week of January this year. A winter opening is a bold move for an ice cream shop, but Milan says things are starting to pick up now that the weather is getting warmer.</p>

        <p> RED HOOK – There are lots of things to like about Red Hook. The views from its shores are among the best in the borough and some of the coastal architecture is straight out of Dickens. But the thing we enjoy that makes it a great food destination is the neighborhood’s ability to make non-residents feel like they’ve stumbled upon a find that they are the first to discover.</p>

        <p>The sprawling, beachy feel of Red Hook makes for great walking and great exploring, so  even when you come upon big names like Brooklyn Crab and Red Hook Lobster Pound, you get the feeling that you’ve lucked out. The best part is, you usually have, as Red Hook is home to some of our favorite spots in Brooklyn.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN HEIGHTS – Haley Fox, co-owner and co-founder of Alice’s Tea Cup, basically found the business’ latest Brooklyn location by accident. </p>

        <p>“I happened upon this location because my stepchildren went to PS8 [right next door], and they actually had already graduated from PS8, but I was walking in the wrong direction and one of my stepdaughters was like, ‘oh, let’s go walk by PS8,’ and we saw the ‘For Rent’ sign here. I was like who has this much sunlight and a corner?” Fox said. Despite this case of kismet, she and her sister, co-owner and co-founder Lauren Fox, had been wanting to open a Brooklyn location for some time to join their two other successful Manhattan spots. </p>

        <p>FORT GREENE – Republic Of Booza, the Williamsburg ice cream spot made famous for its stretchy treats, has opened a pop-up in Fort Greene for the summer. The location debuted on Wednesday, July 3rd and will be open through September. </p>
        
        <p>Billed as “The Original Ice Cream,” booza comes from a traditional Mediterranean style created more than 500 years ago, according to the shop’s website. Republic of Booza has built on this legacy, adding more flavors and choices for their Brooklyn customers. </p>

        <p>MANHATTAN BEACH – Of all of Brooklyn’s beaches, Manhattan Beach might be the most underrated. Just a short walk from Coney Island, it’s an oasis from the crowds of tourists, children, and hot dogs—and one of the only beaches where you can grill your own food. But, other than those grills, options for food are pretty slim.</p>

        <p>The reasons we love Manhattan Beach—its isolation, its local feel—are what limit the spot for dining options. But, that doesn’t mean there’s not anything to get your hands on. We rounded up the best places to eat near Manhattan Beach (in no particular order), so you can sit back, relax, and pretend you’re not just minutes away from one of America’s most crowded boardwalks. </p>

        <p>WINDSOR TERRACE - Cena, a new Mexican eatery and coffee shop in Windsor Terrace, opened on July 12th and neighbors could not be more excited.</p>
            
        <p>“That first weekend was bananas. We put it out on Instagram – ‘We’ll be open today at noon’,” Aron Watman, one of the partners at the new venture, said recalling that Friday. “Everyone [was] already outside. When we opened the door at noon, every table was full. We ran out of food by about six o’clock, so we had to close. Then we reopened on Saturday at two and, same thing. People were here waiting, every table was full, and we ran out of food that day at about 8:30 or so. So, [we] sold out both days,” Watman said.</p>

        <p>WILLIAMSBURG – For Pomp and Circumstance, their small stature is part of their strength. The thirty seat, cozily brick-walled restaurant opened in early June on Lorimer Street right off of the Metropolitan Avenue subway stop, in a part of Williamsburg that still feels like a neighborhood. Even though both owners, general manager Melissa Morales and her husband and head chef James Ahearn, come from much larger venues (Ahearn’s last restaurant was 120 seats, Morales’ was 200), they are right where they want to be. </p>
        
        <p>“We wanted it to be a place where you can go that’s tiny, but you can have a really good meal. That’s why we named it Pomp and Circumstance—that means ‘with fanfare and great celebration,’ and this was kind of taking all of that out of it, and just going to a place where you could have a really great meal,” Morales said. “You could be wearing jeans and not get dressed up, but we still have tablecloths, and we want it to be good and proper service, we’re prepared with all different kinds of glassware. That’s the focus on having it kind of be a teeny-tiny fine dining experience, in a fun neighborhood atmosphere.”</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN HEIGHTS – San Blas Latin Cuisine and Cocktails is named for a sad song about a sad story. Panama’s San Blas Islands are involved, as well as tragic love lost and shipwrecked sailors. However, it is in no way a sad place.</p>
        
            
        <p>It takes up the second floor of 140 Montague Street, with a big window overlooking the street filling the restaurant with light. There are empty spaces on the walls that feel anticipatory – they won’t be empty for long, as management hopes to make the space a hub for art of all kinds, culinary and otherwise.</p>

        <p>BAY RIDGE – Gigi’s Bakery opened in Bay Ridge on June 22nd, right off of the 86th Street R stop, and hopes to appeal to more than those looking for traditional Chinese sweets.</p>
            
        <p>“The majority of our stuff is sweet – it’s traditional Chinese pastries, breads, and cakes. We’re trying to throw in some more American stuff, like croissants and chocolate croissants, because this neighborhood is really diverse,” co-manager of the bakery Eric Chen told Bklyner over the phone. The shop has no public menu, except for cakes, he says, because things change and run out frequently. </p>

        <p>FLATBUSH/MIDWOOD – Mirna’s Pupuseria opened on Flatbush Avenue last Saturday, August 3rd. The spot is fairly small, but makes the most of the space with several tables by the windows facing the avenue, as well as a small counter with 5-6 seats against the far wall. </p>
        
        <p>When we visited on Tuesday at around 1:00 pm, the place was already busy, with a line for food and most of the tables full. </p>
            
        <p>In addition to the pupusas on the menu, they also serve six different soups, including a sopa de mondongo, or tripe soup, and a sope de gallina, or hen soup, both for $11.00. There is an extensive breakfast menu, including egg dishes and bagels, as well as many desserts. You can view the full menu below. </p>

        <p>BOERUM HILL – Brooklyn Baklava has set up a brick and mortar shop on 4th Avenue in Boerum Hill. The big “Coming Soon!” sign in the window is hard to miss, but don’t let it fool you – you can snag the treats now, they just aren’t having their full grand opening for another two weeks or so. </p>
            
        <p>There isn’t much room inside for the customer – a few chairs and space on a display table, so we recommend this for more of a takeout situation. The operation, on the other hand, sprawls back into the building, with big mixing bowls and baking tools on view.</p>

There are whimsical details aplenty – a jukebox, faux flowers on the ceiling, and eccentric light fixtures, with a goal of “something for everyone”. If all goes well, the Bar and Kitchen will be open for customers sometime next week.</p>

        <p>BUSHWICK- Abe’s Pagoda Bar on Wyckoff Avenue opened on April 20th. The space has a tropical feel, with eccentric decorations pretty much everywhere you look. Lamps line the space above the bar, red lanterns make up a hallway, there are two pool tables, a photo booth, and a (not yet functional) jukebox at the front. The space is large, with two rooms and an occupancy of around 70. </p>
            
        <p>“The idea kind of came from Chevy Chase’s [character’s] bar in the movie Caddyshack. His basement bar, his house bar, literally that’s all we talked about for a long time. We would find something on eBay or wherever and be like ‘this is totally his bar, right? Yeah!’ We saw it as this eccentric guy who had a storied life, who traveled in Southeast Asia and all around the world and came home with all of these relics,” Curley said, adding that Martel’s wife is Chinese American, which also influenced the bar’s design. </p>
