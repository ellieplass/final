        <div class="box_one"> <p>PROSPECT HEIGHTS  – It took Antonio Vilchis ten years of running Mexicocina in the Bronx (eleven this November) to consider venturing into Brooklyn, and he does not regret it.  Mexicocina Agaveria, a tidy, small space on Washington Avenue on the edge of Prospect Heights and Crown Heights, opened on March 11.</p> </div>

        <div class="box_two"><p>PARK SLOPE – Contestants at Artichoke Basille’s Pizza eating contest dripped with sweat as they shoved yet another slice into their mouths. And then, another. When you thought they were going to burst, they ate another.</p>

            <p>The fourth annual contest took place last Saturday, the 17th, on Park Slope’s 5th Avenue during the Summer Stroll series, organized by the 5th Avenue Business Improvement District (BID).  There was also salsa dancing, a bouncy castle, and live music.</p>  </div>
        
       <div class="box_three">
           <p>PLG -  The new space at Amy Thai Bistro, one of the only Thai restaurants on Flatbush Avenue, has a minimal design. The walls are a crisp white, and the dishware come in mismatched, rich colors. It feels chic, but warm and inviting.</p>

           <p>This all makes perfect sense once you meet the woman who designed it. Karnchana Vongsawat, known to many as Amy, has worked in the business for years. You might have seen her at Am Thai Bistro, the neighborhood favorite on Church Avenue, which she runs with her business partner, Boonnum Tongngeon. In the last year, both partners, while still working at and operating Am Thai, opened places of their own. Tongngeon’s new place, Thai Cook, opened in Queens about two months after Amy’s. These new restaurants are not sisters to Am Thai, but instead, represent the women as individuals.</p> </div>
        <div class="box_four">
        
            <p>WILLIAMSBURG – Bryan Chunton has kept almost the entirety of his old staff, over ten people, since the original location of his restaurant Zen Yai Noodle & Coffee – a Vietnamese Cafe – burned down last year in Sunnyside, Queens. He jokes that maybe it’s his good looks that keep them around.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="box_five"><p>BAY RIDGE – Just off of the Bay Ridge Avenue R stop, you will find Blend Coffee + CoWork. Right now, at least from the outside, it is a little unassuming—signs and lights are still being installed, but the story behind its origin is anything but. </p>

            <p>Justin Mattera is a pastor, as well as the owner of marketing business. Born and raised in the area where his family has lived for four generations, he never seriously thought that he would own a coffee shop.</p>  </div>
        
        
       <div class="box_six"><p>BENSONHURST – 18th Avenue in Bensonhurst is home to a uniquely wonderful pairing of cultures. These cultures, Chinese and Italian primarily, manifest themselves in a sweet, flaky, and delicious way at the bakeries that line the avenue. In honor of the Santa Rosalia festival, which is on until the first of September, we walked the length of 18th Avenue and tried every bakery we could find.</p><p>There was something to like at every single one, whether it was the espresso-drinking men chatting by the picturesque marzipan creations at Villabate, or kids playing video games at Best Bakery. Each had a distinct and friendly community hanging about inside, each was full of those who knew each other, and each is worth its own trip.</p>  </div> 
        
        
        <div class="box_seven">
            <p>EAST NEW YORK/LINDEN MALL – The best lunch around Linden Mall is at Policano’s Italian Sausage truck.</p>

            <p>Doug Policano has been parking his truck on the north side of Linden Boulevard at 79th Street since 1978, right on the border of Brooklyn and Queens, and locals claim you won’t find a better sausage in either borough. Policiano’s Italian Sausage is about one thing, and one thing only – and it’s right there in the name, and also on the license plate. Sausage. </p>

           <p>CARROLL GARDENS – Milan Schwartz grew up working in the bakery owned by his grandparents, the much-loved Shlukers in Brooklyn, and has now gone on to open an ice cream shop with his wife, Samantha, called Sweet Intentions. The shop is small, pleasantly decorated with a big pink neon sign proclaiming “I licked it, so it’s mine”.</p>

           <p>Sweet Intentions, located at 306 Court Street between Degraw and Sackett, the first week of January this year. A winter opening is a bold move for an ice cream shop, but Milan says things are starting to pick up now that the weather is getting warmer.</p></div> 

        <div class="box_nine">
        
            <p> RED HOOK – There are lots of things to like about Red Hook. The views from its shores are among the best in the borough and some of the coastal architecture is straight out of Dickens. But the thing we enjoy that makes it a great food destination is the neighborhood’s ability to make non-residents feel like they’ve stumbled upon a find that they are the first to discover.</p>

            <p>The sprawling, beachy feel of Red Hook makes for great walking and great exploring, so  even when you come upon big names like Brooklyn Crab and Red Hook Lobster Pound, you get the feeling that you’ve lucked out. The best part is, you usually have, as Red Hook is home to some of our favorite spots in Brooklyn.</p></div>
        
        
        <div class="box_ten">
            <p>BROOKLYN HEIGHTS – Haley Fox, co-owner and co-founder of Alice’s Tea Cup, basically found the business’ latest Brooklyn location by accident. </p>

            <p>“I happened upon this location because my stepchildren went to PS8 [right next door], and they actually had already graduated from PS8, but I was walking in the wrong direction and one of my stepdaughters was like, ‘oh, let’s go walk by PS8,’ and we saw the ‘For Rent’ sign here. I was like who has this much sunlight and a corner?” Fox said. Despite this case of kismet, she and her sister, co-owner and co-founder Lauren Fox, had been wanting to open a Brooklyn location for some time to join their two other successful Manhattan spots. </p>

        <p>FORT GREENE – Republic Of Booza, the Williamsburg ice cream spot made famous for its stretchy treats, has opened a pop-up in Fort Greene for the summer. The location debuted on Wednesday, July 3rd and will be open through September. </p>
        
        <p>Billed as “The Original Ice Cream,” booza comes from a traditional Mediterranean style created more than 500 years ago, according to the shop’s website. Republic of Booza has built on this legacy, adding more flavors and choices for their Brooklyn customers. </p>        
        </div>
        
        
        <div class="box_twelve"><p>MANHATTAN BEACH – Of all of Brooklyn’s beaches, Manhattan Beach might be the most underrated. Just a short walk from Coney Island, it’s an oasis from the crowds of tourists, children, and hot dogs—and one of the only beaches where you can grill your own food. But, other than those grills, options for food are pretty slim.</p>

            <p>The reasons we love Manhattan Beach—its isolation, its local feel—are what limit the spot for dining options. But, that doesn’t mean there’s not anything to get your hands on. We rounded up the best places to eat near Manhattan Beach (in no particular order), so you can sit back, relax, and pretend you’re not just minutes away from one of America’s most crowded boardwalks. </p></div>
